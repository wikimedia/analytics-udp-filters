udp_filter -d en.wikipedia this will log all pageviews (depending 
on the sampling rate) if the domain contains en.wikipedia
.P
udp_filter -p SOPO this will log all pageviews (depending 
on the sampling rate) when the url (excluding the domain name) contains SOPA.

ip address of the visitor with 0.0.0.0

(depending on the sampling rate) where the domain contains en.wikipedia and 
the url contains SOPA and the visitor comes from the US.
