udp-filter (0.2.3) stable; urgency=low

  * Modified behavior of -n --num_fields.  This is now -n --min-field-count.
    There must me more fields in a line than this, otherwise the line will
    be discarded.  The default is 14.  This was done so that we may add
    new fields to the log lines without needing to recompile and redeploy
    in use udp filters at the same time.
  * Changed --country_list to --country-list (with hyphen) to be more
    consistent with usual command line option conventions.
  * This version was written by Andrew Otto (aotto@wikimedia.org)
